		<h1>Looking for the best dentist in El Paso?</h1>
		<h2>Dr. Tamir Shams</h2>
		<p>Dr. Tamir Shams is a professional dentist who excels in his dedication to help his patients achieve the smile they deserve to have. Creating new smiles is Dr. Shams' passion.<br /><br />
		
		Dr. Shams received his graduate degree from Boston University Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine and was one of two students to be awarded the Merit Scholars Scholarship. Granted early admission to Boston University, Dr. Shams was the youngest to graduate from his dental program at 24 years of age.<br /><br />
		
		After graduating from BU, he started his successful practice in Southern California in Cosmetic &amp; Implant Dentistry. Then in 2011 he decided to extend his passion for creating beautiful smiles to the West Texas town of El Paso; bringing the quality of Beverly Hills dentistry along with the artistic Hollywood Smiles to the Sun City. Though a diehard LA Lakers fan, he has grown very fond of El Paso.<br /><br />
		
		Succeeding with opening and operating two dental practices in El Paso, Dr. Shams and Dr. Shayesteh returned to the Golden State of California and opened their third dental practice in West Los Angeles. They warmly welcome you to their newest office located in Culver City.</p><br />
		
		<h2>Dr. Nima Shayesteh</h2>
		<p>Dr. Nima Shayesteh ventured away to the East Coast to pursue his professional passion and attain his Doctorate in Medical Dentistry from Boston University's Goldman School of Dental Medicine. After successful completion, he returned home to the Golden State of California. Reuniting with his family and friends and embarking on a career in Dentistry.<br /><br />
		
		Being adventurous he once again traveled east and found himself in El Paso Texas. Quickly he realized the local demand for quality and esthetic dentistry. His artistic talent that had now crystallized during his practice in Beverly-Hills-type dental offices in California including his exposure to patients of refined taste, quality and expectations, insured that he was the dentist that El Paso lacked. He shared this insight with his colleague and classmate, Dr. Shams and in 2011 they introduced Beverly Hills dentistry to El Pasoans and opened the first Picasso Smiles Dental - Cosmetic & Implant Center. Today, they maintain two successful practices in the El Paso area and they warmly welcome you to their newest office located in Culver City.<br /><br />
		
		The perspective and ethics he maintains on healthcare, supersedes the standard of care. Dr. Shayesteh has been attributed by his colleagues and co-workers for treating each one of his patients as one of his own family members. His commitment to patients indeed motivates him to strive for an exemplary level of attention, thoroughness, quality, and finesse in his dentistry. To achieve such, Dr. Shayesteh continually updates his <a class="blue" href="../../el-paso/about/continuing-education-shayesteh.pdf" onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'pdf', 'click', 'shayesteh');" target="_blank">credentials and continuing education</a>.<br /><br />
		 
		Among the list of the many arduous continuing education trainings, Dr. Shayesteh has successfully completed a one year formal training at the University of Southern California (USC) and has been awarded a certificate in Comprehensive Surgical & Restorative Implant Training. This training has equipped him with the latest techniques, skills, knowledge and technologies to treat patients for their surgical and dental implant needs.<br /><br />
		
		Furthermore, Dr. Shayesteh completed a two year rigorous training program at the F.A.C.E foundation and was awarded a prestigious certificate for Post-Graduate Study in Advanced Occlusion, Restorative and Prosthetic Techniques. Worldwide, only 14 dentists were selected, accepted and graduated from this elite program for the 2015-2017 mentorship training. The skills he attained from this program enables him to treat patients with joint dysfunctions &amp; pain, rehabilitate & reconstruct full mouths, and perform complex dentistry in the most minimally invasive and most conservative modalities also known as Biomimetic Dentistry.<br /><br />
		
		Biomimetic Dentistry is a very tooth-conservative approach to fixing damaged teeth. It is a scientifically proven technique that focuses on the correct bonding and sealing of broken or decayed teeth in a way that copies nature. This means that more of your natural tooth is preserved during every dental procedure at our office. The best dentistry (the dentistry that will be better for your mouth long term) is also the least invasive dentistry. This is the philosophy behind Biomimetic dentistry and Dr. Shayesteh's approach to helping you achieve your best smile. Because we perform minimally invasive procedures, you experience less pain and discomfort, longer-lasting &amp; more esthetically pleasing restorations,  and an overall healthier mouth.<br /><br />
		 
		Dr. Shayesteh is a husband and father. His lovely wife and son is what make him smile. He is a devoted family man and enjoys spending time with both of their families.</p><br />
		
		<h1>Associate doctors</h1>
		<h2>Dr. Francis S. Nahm</h2>
		<p>Originally from Columbus, Ohio, Dr. Nahm is a die-hard Buckeyes fan. Dr. Nahm received his undergraduate education from The Ohio State University and graduated with Honors Distinction. Then he ventured away to New York City to attain his Doctorate degree in Dental Surgery (DDS) from New York University College of Dentistry. After dental school, Dr. Nahm relocated to South Carolina for his Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD) residency program and completed his training with special recognition as the chief resident.<br /><br />
		
		Dr. Nahm is proud to have served in the U.S. Army as a commissioned dental officer. During his service, he received numerous military decorations and awards for his outstanding contributions to the Soldiers and his key leadership roles. Dr. Nahm resigned his commission and was honorably discharged in the rank of Major.<br /><br />
		
		Dr. Nahm is committed to life-long continuing education. In 2014, he earned the coveted Fellowship Award (FAGD) given by the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD). Approximately only 5% of the entire general dentists attain this award. Furthermore, Dr. Nahm is a member in good standing with the American Dental Association (ADA) and the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry (AACD).<br /><br />
		
		Dr. Nahm promises to have his patients benefit from his expertise by bringing utmost empathetic, evidence-based comprehensive care with his savvy, Big Apple taste. You will soon find that he truly cares.<br /><br />
		
		Dr. Nahm is married to most wonderful wife, Diana, and they enjoy their time with two adorable schnauzers. When Dr. Nahm is not in the clinic, he enjoys his time off out at a golf course or can be found at a jazz scene. Don't be fooled by his young appearance!</p><br />
		
		<h2>Dr. Philip Buckler</h2>
		<p>Dr. Buckler grew up in Portland, Oregon, and earned his Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) degree at the University of Detroit Mercy in Michigan. A grateful recipient of the Health Professions Scholarship Program through the U.S. Army, Dr. Buckler completed his Advanced Education in General Dentistry residency at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and was honorably discharged after completing his term of service at Fort Bliss in 2015.<br /><br />
		
		Dr. Buckler is committed to providing all of his patients with the same quality of care that he would want for himself and his family. He is dedicated to continuing education and excellence in the practice of dentistry, and maintains a membership in both the American Dental Association and the Academy of General Dentistry.<br /><br />
		
		When not spending time with his lovely wife Vanessa (and on occasion spoiling their cats), Dr. Buckler enjoys distance running, DIY home improvement projects, and is a tabletop and computer-gaming enthusiast.</p><br />
